                <h1>Biography</h1>
                <p> Caracas, Venezuela, is the capital city of probably one of the most dangerous countries in the world. But besides having a murder rate higher than the war in Afghanistan, “Caraqueños,” as we are locally known, never give up and always find a way to turn things around, even if it requires making a joke out of the undesirable situation.   
	My name is Samuel Navarro and I moved to the United States almost four years ago after graduating from high school to become a Journalist. 
	The reasons why I moved to this country are political, but not entirely. 
	As I grew up I had the opportunity to travel to a lot of different countries and spend summers studying abroad learning English and about the different cultures that make the diversity of this world so enjoyable.
 	Because of these reasons, I became a very open minded and always curious to know the story behind the person next to me. 
	My professional interests are orientated toward the visual arts and story telling. 	Photography is a passion that came to me as a consequence of my journeys and all the things that I saw on the way that I wanted to immortalize. 
	Photographically, my experience comes from traveling and shooting as a hobby. Also from college courses taken previous to this one. 
	My goal after graduation is to write reviews and critics about places that I can combine with my own photography. 
	My shooting equipment is made by a Canon Rebel 3Ti with an 18-55 mm lens and a 75-300 mm telephotolens, and a Gopro.
